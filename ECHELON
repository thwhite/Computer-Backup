/** THE PROBLEM*/

/* 

    -There are scenes. Each of them is drawn when some stimulus is applied. 
		- One possibility is that Draw is static and is advanced only on mouseclick, and the direction mouseclick advances it depends on which button you pressed. 


	-There's a system to keep track of which scenes have been displayed.



	-There are three buttons, and when you press them they move you to another scene. 



	-In the section for the scene declaration, should probably declare all the scvnes first, then actually put them into action.
